### My solution

```py

    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        """
        :type rooms: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def dfs(node):
            for neighbor in rooms[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor)

        visited = {0}
        dfs(0)

        return len(visited)==len(rooms)
