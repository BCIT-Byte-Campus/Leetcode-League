# 2390. Removing Stars From a String

## Approach
1. Keep track the star and remove it 
2. Return the string without '*'
## My solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeStars(String s) {
        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>(); 
        for(char c: s.toCharArray()){
            if(c!='*') st.push(c); 
            else{
                if(st.size()>0)
                st.pop(); 
            }
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); 
        for(char c : st) sb.append(c); 
        return sb.toString(); 
    }
}
```
## What I learned
public class Stack<E> 
- The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
When a stack is first created, it contains no items.

- Constructor
Stack() : Creates an empty Stack. 

- Method: 
1. boolean empty() : Tests if this stack is empty. 
2. peek() : Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
3. pop(): Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function.
4. push(E item) : Pushes an item onto the top of this stack.
```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
stack.push(1); //Add 1 
stack.push(2); //Add 2
stack.push(3); //Add 3
stack.peek(); // Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
stack.pop(); // Remove 3 (LIFO)
stack.clear(); // Initialize the stack 
stack.empty(); //Check whether stack is empty. (if it is empty, true)
stack.contain(1); // Check whether stack contains 1 (if there is 1, true)
```
-Declare: 
```java
import java.util.Stack; // import
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>(); //int형 스택 선언
Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>(); // string형 스택 선언 
```
