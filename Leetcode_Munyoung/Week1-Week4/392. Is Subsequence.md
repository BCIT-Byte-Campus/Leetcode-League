# 392. Is Subsequence

## Approach
1. Make two pointers i and j as indices to traverse the s and t. 
2. Use while loop to compare the characters of s and t 

## My solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        //Intialize the two variables to 0
        int i = 0; 
        int j = 0;

        //Use while loop tp compare characters. 
        //i is within bounds of String 's'
        //j is within bounds of String 't' 
        while( i < s.length() && j < t.length()){
            //If the charater is same, increment the i 
            if(s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)){
                i++; 
            }
            j++; 
        }
        if(i==s.length()) 
        return true; 
        return false; 
    }
}
```
